A relation enables adding multiple *"components"* of the same type to an entity.

> Relations are not stored within archetypes to avoid archetype fragmentation.

A typical limitation of an archetype-based ECS is that an entity can only contain one component of a certain type.  
When adding a component of a specific type to an entity already present the component is updated.  
This is the common behavior implemented by most ECS implementations like **EnTT**, **flecs**, **BEVY**, **fenn**ecs, ... .  

**Terminology**  
A relation in mathematical context describes a connection between the elements of two sets: *Set-1* & *Set-2*.  
In other words - a relation is a pair (element of *Set-1*, element of *Set-2*).

In friflo ECS a relation is a type implementing either `IRelation<>` or `IRelationLink<>`.  
An entity containing a relation creates a relation between this entity and the relation key.  
So *Set-1* are always **all entities** and *Set-2* are all possible **relation keys**.  

- A **relation** implements `IRelation<>` and is a pair (entity, relation key)
- A **relationship** implements `IRelationLink<>` and is a pair (entity, linked entity)

## Relation

Multiple relations can be added to a single entity and must implement
[`IRelation<>`](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Engine-docs/blob/main/api/IRelation_TKey_.md).  
To distinguish between different relations, a relation type must implement `GetRelationKey()`.  
Any type can be used as relation key type. E.g. enum, string, int, long, Guid, DateTime, ... .

Relations are added, removed and queried with
```cs
    entity.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Coin });
    entity.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Axe  });
    entity.RemoveRelation <InventoryItem,ItemType>(ItemType.Coin);
    entity.GetRelations   <InventoryItem>();                        // O(1)
    entity.GetRelation    <InventoryItem,ItemType>(ItemType.Axe);   // O(N)
    // N: number of relations on a single entity
```

The following example illustrates the state changes of a specific entity regarding its relations.  
It uses an `enum` as relation key type.

```cs
enum ItemType {
    Coin    = 1,
    Axe     = 2,
}

struct InventoryItem : IRelation<ItemType> { // relation key type: ItemType
    public  ItemType    type;
    public  int         count;
    public  ItemType    GetRelationKey() => type;     // unique relation key
}

public static void Relations()
{
    var store   = new EntityStore();
    var entity  = store.CreateEntity();
    
    // add multiple relations of the same component type
    entity.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Coin, count = 42 });
    entity.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Axe,  count =  3 });
    
    // Get all relations added to an entity.   O(1)
    entity.GetRelations  <InventoryItem>();                       // { Coin, Axe }
    
    // Get a specific relation from an entity. O(N)
    entity.GetRelation   <InventoryItem,ItemType>(ItemType.Coin); // {type=Coin, count=42}
    
    // Remove a specific relation from an entity
    entity.RemoveRelation<InventoryItem,ItemType>(ItemType.Axe);
    entity.GetRelations  <InventoryItem>();                       // { Coin }
}
```

The relations of an `Entity` can be modified within a `foreach` loop by accessing the elements by `ref`.
```cs
    var relations = entity.GetRelations<InventoryItem>();
    foreach(ref var relation in relations) {
        relation.count += 1;
    }
```
> **Important**  
> Within loop iteration relations must not be added or removed.  
> Doing this invalidates the iteration result.

Retrieving all entity relations is shown by the example below.
```cs
public static void AllRelations()
{
    var store   = new EntityStore();
    var entity1 = store.CreateEntity();
    var entity2 = store.CreateEntity();
    
    // add relations to multiple entities
    entity1.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Coin, count = 10 });
    entity2.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Coin, count = 20 });
    entity2.AddRelation(new InventoryItem { type = ItemType.Axe,  count =  1 });
    
    var allRelations = store.EntityRelations<InventoryItem>();
    // all entities with relations
    var uniqueEntities = allRelations.Entities;         // count: 2
    
    // all entity relation pairs
    var allRelations = store.EntityRelations<InventoryItem>();
    
    // all entities with relations
    var uniqueEntities = allRelations.Entities;     // count: 2
    
    // all entity relation pairs
    var (entities, relations) = allRelations.Pairs; // count: 3
}
```


**Note** - Breaking changes since `3.0.0-preview.16`

1. To avoid mixing up relations with components accidentally `IRelation` does not extends `IComponent` anymore.
2. Renamed public API's  
   `IRelationComponent<>` -> `IRelation<>`  
   `RelationComponents<>` -> `Relations<>`

## Serialization

Serialization of relations as JSON is supported since `3.0.0-preview.17` or higher.  
Its encoding similar to the serialization of components.  
In contrast to components relations are serialized as an array of components as a single entity can have multiple relations.

```json
{
    "id": 42,
    "components": {
        "relations": [{"value":42},{"value":43}],
        "component": {"value":42}
    }
}
```

## Benchmark - Relations

The number of link relations / relations per entity should not exceed 100.  
The reason is that inserting and removing a relation is executed in O(N).  
N: number of relations per entity.

*Benchmark* [see Tests](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Engine.ECS/blob/main/src/Tests/ECS/Relations/Test_Relations_Query.cs)  
Add 1.000.000 int relations. Type:
```cs
internal struct IntRelation : IRelation<int> {
    public          int     value;
    public          int     GetRelationKey()    => value;
}
```
